										PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, 
										ALONG WITH THE PRIVACY POLICY AND OTHER POLICIES
										OR AGREEMENTS REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, 
										BEFORE USING THE CODEBLACK&nbsp;&nbsp;ONDEMAND DIGITAL 
										ENTERTAINMENT SERVICE.  BY USING THE SERVICE, 
										YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, INCLUDING
										WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
										AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH 
										23 BELOW.
									</div>

									<div class="terms-post">
										Codeblack&nbsp;&nbsp;OnDemand is a digital entertainment service 
										(the “<strong>Service</strong>”) provided by Lions Gate Entertainment Inc.
										or one of its affiliates (“<strong>Lionsgate</strong>”).  The Service enables 
										our members to browse our catalogue, watch movies, 
										television shows, video content and/or other digital 
										entertainment content over the Internet on compatible
										Internet connected TVs, computers, mobile phones,
										tablets and other devices. These Terms of Service (the 
										“<strong>Terms of Service</strong>” or “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) set forth the legal 
										terms and conditions governing your use of the Service. 
										Your use of the Service confirms your unconditional 
										agreement to be bound by these Terms of Service and is
										subject to your continued compliance with these Terms of
										Service.  If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms 
										of Service, you acknowledge that you have no right or license
										to access or otherwise use the Service. Before using the Service,
										please review the related <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a>  and <a href="#">End 
										User License Agreement </a>, both of which are
										incorporated herein by this reference.  Your use of certain 
										products offered through the Service may require you to accept 
										additional terms and conditions that apply to those products in addition 
										to this Agreement.  In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between 
										those additional terms and this Agreement, those additional terms will 
										prevail with respect to your use of that particular product.
									</div>

									<h2 class="terms-title">
										<span class="terms-numb">1.</span> Eligibility
									</h2>

									<div class="terms-post">
										The Service is intended for users who are eighteen (18) 
										years of age and older. Individuals who are under the age 
										of eighteen (18) may access the Service only with the 
										knowledge and consent of a parent or legal guardian, 
										under such person’s Account, and otherwise in accordance 
										with these Terms of Service. Certain parts of the Service 
										may be subject to heightened age and/or other eligibility
										requirements.
									</div>

									<h2 class="terms-title">
										<span class="terms-numb">2.</span>
										Account Registration
									</h2>

									<div class="terms-post">
										Certain parts or features of the Service may require 
										you to create a membership Account (“<strong>Account</strong>”). 
										To create an Account, you will be required to create 
										a user name and password, provide certain personal 
										information about yourself (collectively, “<strong>Registration Information</strong>”), 
										and provide a valid credit card or other 
										accepted method of payment (a “<strong>Payment Method</strong>”). 
										By providing the Payment Method, you represent and 
										warrant that you are authorized to use such Payment
										Method.  The Payment Method and other billing information 
										that you submit (“<strong>Personal Billing Information</strong>”) is a
										subset of your Registration Information.  Your Personal 
										Billing Information may be collected by an independent 
										third party selected by, but not affiliated with, Lionsgate
										(the “<strong>Payment Processor</strong>”).  The use of your Personal
										Billing Information will be used by Lionsgate in 
										accordance with its Privacy Policy, but the use of your
										Personal Billing Information by any Payment Processor 
										will be governed by such Payment Processor’s own
										independent privacy policy, and in the event the Payment 
										Processor fails to comply with its own privacy policy or
										experiences a data breach that affects any of your
										Personal Billing Information or other data, Lionsgate
										will in no way be responsible or liable to you for such 
										activity.  
										You agree that you will not provide any false personal
										information to the Service, or create an Account for 
										anyone other than yourself without permission. You 
										will also not create more than one personal profile, 
										and if you select a username for your Account, we
										reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe
										appropriate (such as if a trademark owner complains 
										about a username). If you register with the Service, 
										you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality 
										of your password and for restricting access to your 
										compatible devices so that others may not access the 
										password protected portion of the Service. To provide
										our members with easy access to their Accounts, Lionsgate 
										may implement technology that recognizes you or your 
										device and provides you with direct access to your Account 
										without having to login or type in your password or other
										Account identifier.  Take care in enabling this technology. 
										You accept responsibility for all activities and transactions 
										that occur under your Account, regardless of how it is accessed.
										Your Payment Method will be charged on a one-time basis for
										each purchase or rental. PAYMENTS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE 
										AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS.  We reserve 
									</div>
									<div class="terms-post">
										the right to adjust the pricing for the Service at any time in 
										our sole discretion.  By providing a Payment Method, you 
										authorize Lionsgate (or its Payment Processor) to
										charge the rental fee or purchase price at the then current rate.  
										When you set up an Account, you consent to receive
										communications from us electronically, and any 
										agreements, notices, disclosures or other communications
										that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal 
										requirement that such communication be in writing.
									</div>


									<h2 class="terms-title">

										License to the Service
									</h2>

									<div class="terms-post">
										Lionsgate grants members of the Service whose Accounts are
										in good standing a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
										non-sublicensable, limited license to access and use the Service
										and privately view the materials thereon for your personal, 
										non-commercial use only, provided that you comply fully 
										with these Terms of Service and the <a href="#">End User License Agreement</a>. 
										You shall not interfere (or permit the use of your membership by 
										a third party to interfere) or attempt to interfere with the operation 
										or use of Service by other members in any way through any
										means or device including, but not limited to, spamming, hacking, 
										uploading computer viruses or time bombs, or any other means 
										expressly prohibited by any provision of these Terms of Service.&nbsp;
										You understand that some of the Material that is available on 
										the Service may be protected by security technology, and you
										agree not to circumvent, disable, disassemble, remove, alter, deactivate, 
										degrade or otherwise tamper with such security technology.  
										Lionsgate may, in its sole discretion, and at any time, with or 
										without notice, suspend, disable or terminate your membership 
										(free or paid), and/or access to all or any part of the Service at 
										any time, with or without prior notice, for any reason or no reason 
										at all, without liability.  If we terminate your membership or disable 
										your Account, you agree that you will not create another one or
										otherwise try to access the Service without our permission.&nbsp;You
										agree not to sell, transfer or assign your membership or any 
										membership rights.

										Changes to Service and/or Terms of Service
									</h2>

									<div class="terms-post">
										Lionsgate reserves the right, from time to time, in its sole
										discretion, to change, modify, update, discontinue, remove, 
										revise, delete or otherwise change any portion of the 
										Service or these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, 
										at any time without further notice. For changes to these 
										Terms of Service that we deem material, we will place a 
										notice on the website that hosts the Service by revising the 
										link on the homepage to read substantially as “Updated 
										Terms of Service” for a reasonable amount of time.  
										If you access the Service through a mobile device, such 
										changes may also be communicated through updated versions 
										of the Service software, which you consent to receive without
										further notice.  If you access or use the Service in any way
										after the Terms of Service have been changed, you will be
										deemed to have read, understood and unconditionally
										consented to and agreed to such changes. The most current
										version of these Terms of Service will be available on 
										the website <a class="tb" href="http://www.codeblack.com/">www.codeblack.com</a> and will supersede all 
										previous versions of these Terms of Service.

										time you register for the Service may not reflect the content 
										library that will be offered throughout your membership and

										We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy

									These Terms of Service, along with the Privacy Policy, 
									End User License Agreement and any other policies 
									expressly incorporated into these Terms of Service by 
									reference, constitute the entire agreement between you 
									and Lionsgate with respect to the subject matter hereof 
									and supersede all prior or contemporaneous written or oral
									agreements between the us with respect to the subject matter
									hereof. These Terms of Service may not be amended, nor any 
									obligation waived, without Lionsgate’s written authorization. 
									Any failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Service 
									shall not constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision
									thereof.&nbsp;
								</div>

								<div class="terms-post">
									These Terms of Service shall be governed and construed
									in accordance with the laws of the State of California 
									applicable to contracts entered into and fully performed in 
									California (without regard to its conflicts of law principles 
									that would cause the application of any other jurisdiction's laws).  
									With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration,
									you agree not to commence or prosecute any action in connection
									therewith other than in the state and federal courts of California, 
									and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of 
									personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect 
									to venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of 
									California.&nbsp;
								</div>

								<div class="terms-post">
									By using the Service in any way, you unconditionally 
									consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or 
									controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) 
									you may have against you may have against the Lionsgate 
									Parties arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way 
									with the Service or the determination of the scope or 
									applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved 
									exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by
									JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance
									with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration agreement is 
									made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce,
									and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“<strong>FAA</strong>”), 
									9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in Los 
									Angeles, California; (4) the arbitrator’s decision shall be 
									controlled by the terms and conditions of this Agreement 
									and any of the other agreements referenced herein that 
									the applicable user may have entered into in connection 
									with the website; (5) the arbitrator shall apply California
									law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, 
									and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (6)
									there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated
									on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide
									only your and/or the applicable Lionsgate Party’s individual 
									claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims 
									of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; 
									(7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award 
									punitive damages against you or any Lionsgate Party; 
									(8) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits 
									that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Lionsgate
									Party exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or not required 
									under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits
									that exceed this amount, Lionsgate agrees to pay them
									and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate 
									allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to 
									demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive 
									as compared to the costs of litigation, Lionsgate will pay as
									much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the 
									arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent 
									the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with
									the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this 
									arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable
									or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, 
									then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain 
									in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms
									as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting
									provision were not contained herein. If, however,
									subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, 
									then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null 
									and void, and neither you nor Lionsgate shall be entitled to
									arbitrate their dispute. For more information on JAMS 
									and/or the rules of JAMS, visit their website at&nbsp;<a class="tb" href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a>.
