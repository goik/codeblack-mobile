								<div class="terms-post">

									connection and/or the definition you 
									selected for your Media.  Lionsgate 
									makes no representations or warranties 
									about the quality of your viewing experience 
									on your Authorized Device or the ability of 
									any Authorized Device to access or play the 
									Media.  In order to stream or download Media, 
									your Authorized Device must meet certain 
									system requirements, including but not 
									limited to having high speed Internet 
									access. You are responsible for all
									Internet access and data transmission 
									charges.  Please check with your
									Internet provider for information 
									on possible Internet data usage charges.
								</div>

								<div class="terms-post">
									<strong>3.2 Authorized Devices and Compatibility.</strong>  
									Lionsgate does not warrant that the Software provided
									by Lionsgate to utilize the Service or any 
									other software used in connection with the Service 
									will be compatible with any third party software nor
									does Lionsgate warrant that operation of the Service
									and the associated Software will not damage or disrupt

									OR OTHERWISE WARRANT THAT THE PEFORMANCE OF
									ANY AUTHORIZED DEVICE, INCLUDING BUT NOT

								<strong>9. General Terms:</strong>
							</div>

							<div class="terms-post">
								<strong>9.1 Governing Law and Choice of Forum.</strong> This Agreement 
								shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance
								with the laws of the United States and the State of 
								California, without regard to the conflicts or choice of
								law rules thereof that would result in the application of
								any other jurisdiction's laws. With respect to any disputes
								or claims not subject to arbitration, you agree not to 
								commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith 
								other than in the state and federal courts of California, and 
								you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of 
								personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect 
								to venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of California.
							</div>
							<div class="terms-post">
								By using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent 
								and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy 
								(whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have 
								against the Lionsgate Entities arising out of, relating to, 
								or connected in any way with the website or the determination
								of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, 
								will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration 
								administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator 
								in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration 
								agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate 
								commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act 
								(“<strong>FAA</strong>”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in
								Los Angeles, California; (4) the arbitrator’s decision shall be
								controlled by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
								any of the other agreements referenced herein that the 
								applicable user may have entered into in connection with the
								website; (5) the arbitrator shall apply California law consistent 
								with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor 
								claims of privilege recognized at law; (6) there shall be no authority 
								for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, 
								arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Lionsgate
								Entity’s individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or
								join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly 
								situated; (7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award 
								punitive damages against you or any Company Entity; (8) in the 
								event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid 
								to initiate arbitration against any Lionsgate Entity exceed $125 USD,
								and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay 
								any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Company agrees to
								pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate 
								allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to 
								demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive 
								as compared to the costs of litigation, Company will pay as 
								much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the
								arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
								arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the 
								exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration 
								provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or 
								otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance 
								of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall 
								be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, 
								unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained 
								herein. If, however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable
								or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be
								null and void, and neither you nor Company shall be entitled to 
								arbitrate their dispute. For more information on JAMS and/or
								the rules of JAMS, visit their website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a>.

							<div class="terms-post">
								<strong>9.2 Severability.</strong> If any term or provision of this Agreement
								is declared void or unenforceable in a particular situation, 
								by any judicial or administrative authority, this declaration
								shall not affect the validity of enforceability of the remaining 
								terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability 
								of the offending term or provision in any other situation, and
								under such circumstances, the balance of this Agreement shall
								remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its
